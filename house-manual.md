###Cleanliness
- Keepon is watching you and wants you to feel bad if you leave a mess.
- if the dishwasher is running, hand wash your dish
- if the dishwasher is clean, empty it and put your dish in there or handwash your dish
- dishwasher detergent is underneath the sink
- if you leave a mess, it will be photographed and sent out and you will be shamed

###Food storage
- label your food with masking tape and the sharpies by the sink (TODO: kh)
- food that is not labelled is assumed to be communal
- containers should be labelled with dates of origin. Anything kept around for greater than a week will be tossed.
- any open food that is left in the fridge will be thrown away within 48 hours - cover your food or put it in a container
- anything molding will be tossed out. No questions asked
- (TODO: kh) Fridge space is labelled. Please concentrate your things in the appropriate space
- (TODO: kh) Cabinet space is labelled. Please concentrate your things in the appropriate space

###Trash
- if the trash is overflowing, take it out. Seriously. 
- compost is compost in the metal bins, recycling is recycling in the blue bin, trash is trash in the black bin. Ask Kat or Hannah if you need a lesson on what constitutes trash, recycling, or compost. 
- trash should be taken out to the bins in the garage or behind the black gate (TODO: Cy) the key to the gate will be at a specific location for when you are going out to the gate
- Trash and compost bags are beneath the sink.
