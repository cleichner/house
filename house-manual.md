###Trash
- if the trash is overflowing, take it out. Seriously. 
- compost is compost in the metal bins, recycling is recycling in the blue bin, trash is trash in the black bin. Ask Kat or Hannah if you need a lesson on what constitutes trash, recycling, or compost. 
- trash should be taken out to the bins in the garage or behind the black gate (TODO: Cy) the key to the gate will be at a specific location for when you are going out to the gate
- Trash and compost bags are beneath the sink.
