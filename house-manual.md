- Dishwasher detergent can be found underneath the sink.

**Trash**
- Compost: silver, metal bins

- If the trash bins are full, do not put more trash in. Either (a) empty the bin and take the bag down to the garage or (b) find a different bin.
- If the bins in the garage are full, put the trash in the gated area catacorner to the front gate. The key to this gated corner is in the lockbox at the front gate.
