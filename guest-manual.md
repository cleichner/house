# Masonic - Guest Manual

Hello! [Welcome to Masonic](http://masonic.io)!

Our house is large. [Lots of people](/contact.md) live here.
So we have made a list of the rules and guidelines that govern
us. We've condensed the ones relevant to guests in this document.
Please make sure you read the whole thing! There are important
things you need to know -- including safety concerns.

We hope you enjoy the visit with us!

Love,
Masonic House
